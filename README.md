<ul>
<li>Flask (Python)</li>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>Bootstap</li>
</ul>

This is Nirma's first social netwrok website. The network architechture is based on anonymous self- stabilizing algorithm. Your identity is completely masked so SPEAK YOUR HEART OUT!
<ul>

<li>Agree or Disagree with the happenings in the college.</li>
<li>Confessions that never came out.</li>
<li>Changes in the rules of university or working of clubs</li>
<li>Express anything you want because nobody knows who you are!</li>
</ul>
